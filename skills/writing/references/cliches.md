# LLM cliché catalog

Deterministic detectors ported from Simon Willison's [LLM cliché highlighter](https://tools.simonwillison.net/llm-cliche-highlighter) ([source](https://github.com/simonw/tools/blob/main/llm-cliche-highlighter.html), Apache-2.0). Wikipedia group items follow [Signs of AI writing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing).

This is a **detect** catalog. Do not treat a single hit as proof of authorship. Several hits, or a chain with a high item count, is a tell.

Run:

```bash
skills/writing/scripts/cliche-lint.mjs --list
skills/writing/scripts/lint.sh draft.md
skills/writing/scripts/cliche-lint.mjs --off colon-triple,fits-in-your-head draft.md
skills/writing/scripts/cliche-lint.mjs --version   # catalogue version; --list shows each entry's source
```

Fenced code and inline code are masked before matching. Markdown structure is not prose either: a list marker never counts as a sentence's first word, and `echo-triad` skips table rows, whose cells repeat by design. Cell text is still matched by every other detector.
Every entry carries a source and the catalogue version it shipped in. Adding, retiring, or
measuring tells is `scripts/CATALOGUE.md`; tells decay, so the catalogue is maintained, not frozen.

## After a hit

Rewrite the flagged span into a direct claim. Do not swap in a different cliché. Do not inject slang to dodge the matcher.
